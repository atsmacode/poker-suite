# Poker Suite

A new app I started, recreating the same game logic from [Aye Poker](https://github.com/atsmacode/aye-poker) with Laravel / Vue.

I'm adding the extra feature of building Scenarios where you can select players, cards and actions and receive calculated odds of winning the hand and advice. The classes used to build a Scenario will be the same ones used to run an actual Game.
